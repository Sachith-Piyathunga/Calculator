## 🖼️ User Interface Structure

The UI is divided into two main sections:

- **Left Panel:**  
  Contains the display, keypad (with 20 buttons), and theme toggle.
  
- **Right Panel:**  
  Scrollable history log with a clear button, styled separately for easy visibility.

> Responsive layout using `BorderLayout` and `GridLayout` ensures consistent alignment across different screen sizes.

## 🧠 Calculator Logic

- **State Tracking Variables**
  - `A`: First operand
  - `operator`: Selected operation
  - `waitingForSecondOperand`: Ensures the second input isn't concatenated incorrectly
  - `justEvaluated`: Prevents repeated equals and manages history input
  - `currentExpression`: Full math expression string for history

- **Execution Flow**
  - Button press → input handler → display update → optional history logging
  - Theme toggle applies new color scheme using the `updateTheme()` method
  - Keyboard adapter maps key presses to equivalent button logic

## 🎨 Theme Design

| Light Mode | Dark Mode |
|------------|-----------|
| Bright background, black text | Dark background, white text |
| Soft light buttons | Muted dark buttons |
| Green accent for operators | Consistent in both themes |
| 🌓 Theme toggle icon | 🌙 (light) ↔ ☀️ (dark) |
